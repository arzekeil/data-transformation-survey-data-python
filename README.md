# üêí Survey Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing survey data collected through a SurveyMonkey survey. The goal is to clean, process, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights that can be used for decision-making.

## Project Structure

- **Data-Survey Monkey Output.xlsx**: The original raw data extracted from SurveyMonkey.
- **Data-Survey Monkey Output Edited.xlsx**: The cleaned and processed version of the raw data.
- **Final_Output.xlsx**: The final dataset, ready for analysis or reporting.
- **Script-Data_Manipulation.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

## Data Description

The dataset contains multiple columns representing various aspects of the survey, such as:
- **Respondent Demographics**: Information like division, position, gender, and tenure.
- **Survey Responses**: Answers to various survey questions, categorized and stored in different columns.

## Key Steps in Data Processing

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed any incomplete or irrelevant data.
   - Standardized column names and formats for consistency.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Aggregated and pivoted data where necessary.
   - Merged or split data columns based on analysis requirements.

## Usage

To reproduce the analysis or modify the code, you can use the `Script-Data_Manipulation.ipynb` notebook. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to see the data processing steps.
3. Modify the code as needed to fit your specific requirements.

## Results

The final output is stored in `Final_Output.xlsx`, containing the cleaned and processed data, ready for reporting or further analysis.
